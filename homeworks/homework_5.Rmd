This homework concerns functions.

1. Make a function that reads in data and does some sort of manipulation of it. Undergrads, use the surveys dataset. Graduates, use your own data. Any manipulation is fine: selection, filtering, value removal. 

```{r}

# Answer here
```

2. Add a test to this function. How will you know if it worked, and alert a user if it did not?

```{r}
# Answer here
```

3. Make a function that makes a plot. This can be any type of plot that we covered. Violin, box, scatter. Include the ability to save the plot to a file in the function.

```{r}
# Answer here
```

4. For saving to a file, users of your function may want the ability to choose their file name. Make the filename an argument so that users can do so.

```{r}
# Answer here.

```
