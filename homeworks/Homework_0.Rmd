```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Due Aug. 18th at 5pm. Simply write your answers in and save in the homeworks folder in your Rstudio.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Homework for this class will be in RMarkdown Format

Therefore, we will now learn to download the homework to your RStudio in RMarkdown Format. 

Each homework will contain a link to download the homework. It will look like this at first: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BiologicalDataAnalysis2019/2023/main/vignettes/homework_0.Rmd", destfile = "/cloud/project/homeworks/Homework_0.Rmd")
```

**You will run this cell once and only once.** If you run it again without changing the destfile, it will overwrite your file. You will note that the destfile specifies that we will be downloading the file into a folder called homework. We created this in class; if you did not please do so now.

Download the homework. This is all I need you to do for this week's homework.
