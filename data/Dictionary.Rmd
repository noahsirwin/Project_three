ccn-ccs-ccw-cce Canopy cover measurements collected in all four cardinal directions out of ()/17
cc_total Percentage of canopy cover calculated by averaging the numerator of each direction an then dividing by 17 and then multiplying by 100.
collection_time-Time spent collecting salamanders from the streams in hours.
sample_size- Number of salamanders collected during the sample trip designated
cpe- Catch-Perunit-Effort (salamanders/Hr)calcualted by dividing sample_size by collection_time divided by 2 if the solo column is FALSE
solo- If this was a solo trip then TRUE if I was accompanied then FALSE
leaf_litter1-leaf_litter3- number of squares filled with allochthonous material in a 25 square quadrant. A picture of the quadrant was taken at three different locations in the stream
leaf_litter_total- Leaf Litter area (m^2) is calcualted by  averaging the numerators of leaf_litter1-leaf_litter3 and then divided by 25. The number is then multiplied by .01m^2
